# react-i18next vs local storage expmple

A simple example of using the [react-i18next](https://github.com/i18next/react-i18next) library with local storage.

The default language is Ukrainian. When a user changes the language, it is written to local storage and the next time the application logs in, it will be translated into the language that the user selected last time.
